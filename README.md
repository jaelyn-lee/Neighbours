This is a social app designed to connect neighbours in a local community. The app allows users to check the latest news, weather, activities, and the marketplace within their neighbourhood. We have used Auth0 to authenticate users and protect them from faulty users. The app's front-end development and styling were done by me, and I implemented front-end functionality to display data from the database. To prevent writing repetitive code, I also created a UI component for duplicative components, such as buttons or posts. Through this project, I gained experience in agile methodology using a ticketing system and handling complex data structures. Currently, the database is only connected to the classified section, but we are working to finalize the connection for activities and the market as well.
